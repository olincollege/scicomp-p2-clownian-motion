# Clownian Motion
Authored by @zbwrm (Aydin O'Leary) and @mmadanguit (Marion Madanguit).

Python script that models brownian motion of particles and hopefully, eventually, colloidal glass transitions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Run `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` to set up and activate a virtual environment. 
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies. 

## Run

1. Run `python particles.py` to run our simulation. The output of this simulation should be saved to a file called data.csv; in the command-line, this can be done with `python particles.py > data.csv`.
2. Run `python visualization.py` to see a visualization of the simulation.
